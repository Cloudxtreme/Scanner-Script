# This is my first real bash script. It simply asks for a directory name and
# checks if it exists in /root is not it makes the directory you named.

# It then asks for an IP address or a range of IP addresses.

# It then asks for Port/s to be scanned.

# Finally it asks what you would like to name this file and stores it in the 
# /root/* what ever you named your directory at the begining.
